# Enterprise GA Ticket Board

Last updated: 2026-05-17

## Purpose

This board turns the existing enterprise-hardening work into a productization
plan for an enterprise-ready Kublai release.

The repository already has substantial enterprise engineering closure:

- security, identity, trust-material rotation, PAT governance, and release
  provenance are documented as closed
- tenant isolation, governance, legal holds, audit export, and compliance
  evidence APIs are present
- HA topology, dependency failure semantics, upgrade compatibility, reliability
  drills, and performance soak guides exist
- deployment assets include Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, Helm, Grafana,
  alert thresholds, and environment templates

The remaining gap is not primarily core correctness. The remaining gap is the
difference between a hardened engineering repository and a product that a large
organization can evaluate, procure, install, operate, upgrade, audit, and get
support for with low ambiguity.

## Enterprise Ready Definition

Kublai is enterprise ready when a target customer can complete all of the
following without direct maintainer intervention:

1. evaluate the security model, support envelope, and architecture
2. install a signed release into a supported production shape
3. connect enterprise identity and tenant administration
4. run backup, restore, upgrade, rollback, and incident drills
5. export audit/compliance evidence for review
6. operate dashboards and alerts from documented SLOs
7. diagnose common failures and produce a support bundle
8. upgrade between supported versions under a published lifecycle policy

## Priority Key

- `P0`: enterprise launch blocker
- `P1`: required before first paid production customer
- `P2`: required before broad enterprise rollout
- `P3`: follow-up hardening or adoption accelerator

## Status Key

- `todo`: not started
- `in_progress`: started but not launch-ready
- `done`: implemented and validated
- `blocked`: waiting on a decision or dependency
- `deferred`: intentionally outside the current launch

### EGA-13: Run release provenance on a real signed tag

Scope:
- Create a release candidate tag and exercise `.github/workflows/release-provenance.yml`.
- Verify downloaded artifacts using the documented verification helper.

Acceptance criteria:
- Release provenance evidence references a real tag, checksums, signatures, and
  SBOMs.
- Any manual gaps in the release process become tickets before GA.

Status:
- done for signed tag `v0.1.0-rc.3`
- release workflow run: `25978805669`
- certification helper:
  `scripts/release-provenance-certify.sh`

- validation release: signed tag `v0.1.0-rc.2`

### EGA-31: Persist consolidated enterprise verification evidence

Scope:
- Extend `scripts/verify-enterprise.sh` so the enterprise verification battery
  writes a top-level report artifact under `docs/reports`.
- Capture the executed commit, SDK version, start/end timestamps, command list,
  pass/fail status for each step, and links to generated drill/baseline reports.
- Preserve the existing fail-fast behavior while still writing enough failure
  context for release review.

Rationale:
- The current verification battery validates the right paths, but the top-level
  result is only emitted to stdout.
- Enterprise GA sign-off needs durable evidence tying unit tests, integration
  tests, load baseline, backup/restore, upgrade compatibility, reliability,
  search soak, and performance soak into one release-candidate record.

Acceptance criteria:
- `make verify-enterprise` produces
  `docs/reports/enterprise-verification-latest.md`.
- The report includes status, timestamps, commit, SDK/runtime version, and each
  verification step.
- The report links to or names all generated subreports.
- A failed step records the failing command and status before the script exits.

Status:
- done in `scripts/verify-enterprise.sh`
- latest evidence: `docs/reports/enterprise-verification-latest.md`

### EGA-32: Define kublai.com production hosting hardware plan

Scope:
- Select the launch hosting shape for `kublai.com`.
- Define Dev, PreProd, and Prod compute, database, object storage, ingress,
  Cloudflare, observability, backup, and DNS/TLS requirements.
- Estimate monthly run cost and identify account/provider decisions that must be
  made before purchase.
- Tie the hosting shape back to the supported product envelope, production
  cutover guide, production preflight, and release sign-off gates.

Acceptance criteria:
- A production hosting plan exists with recommended node count, node size,
  database class, object-storage capacity, load balancer, Cloudflare settings,
  monitoring, and backup posture.
- The plan includes budgetary cost ranges and provider pricing references.
- Dev, PreProd, and Prod are separated by namespace, database, bucket, DNS, and
  credentials.
- Cutover to `kublai.com` is blocked until preflight, smoke tests,
  backup/restore evidence, release provenance, and rollback ownership are
  complete.
- Open provider/account decisions are listed explicitly.

Status:
- in_progress with initial plan in
  `docs/73-kublai-com-production-hosting-plan.md`
- preferred candidate updated to Akamai Cloud/Linode with Cloudflare fronting
  production traffic
- environment topology added for Dev, PreProd, and Prod isolation

### EGA-33: Remove MinIO as strategic object-storage dependency

Scope:
- Stop treating MinIO community artifacts as a safe long-term default dependency.
- Define the immediate `kublai.com` managed object-storage path.
- Identify every local, kind, Helm, and documentation path that still depends on
  MinIO.
- Create a side-project charter for an Kublai-owned S3-compatible object
  store if maintained third-party options are not acceptable.

Acceptance criteria:
- Production deployment guidance recommends managed S3-compatible object
  storage for `kublai.com`.
- MinIO usage in local validation is documented as temporary test
  infrastructure.
- A compatibility/conformance plan exists for object-storage providers.
- A side-project decision record exists for a potential Kublai-owned
  replacement.
- Follow-up implementation tickets exist before removing MinIO from validation
  scripts.

Status:
- in_progress with exit plan in
  `docs/74-object-storage-independence-and-minio-exit-plan.md`

### EGA-35: Evaluate Garage as MinIO replacement candidate

Scope:
- Evaluate Garage as the preferred self-hosted S3-compatible replacement
  candidate before starting a Kublai-owned object-store project.
- Validate the exact Kublai object-storage contract against Garage: bucket
  bootstrap, object put/get/delete, multipart upload, range reads, presigned
  URLs, metadata, auth signing, retries, and deterministic error behavior.
- Add a temporary Garage-backed local or CI validation path that can run beside
  the existing MinIO fixture until the replacement decision is made.
- Document Garage operating constraints, AGPLv3 license obligations, backup and
  restore posture, Helm/Compose deployment shape, monitoring needs, and
  migration path from MinIO.
- Decide whether the Boorchu side project remains necessary after Garage
  compatibility and operations testing.

Acceptance criteria:
- A Garage compatibility matrix exists for all S3 operations Kublai uses.
- Existing object-storage integration tests pass against Garage or each gap is
  documented with severity and workaround.
- Dev/kind/Helm deployment notes include a Garage option without removing the
  current MinIO fixture prematurely.
- Licensing and distribution implications of using Garage are documented for
  Kublai releases and customer deployments.
- The MinIO exit plan is updated with a go/no-go recommendation: adopt Garage,
  keep managed S3 only, or bootstrap Boorchu.

Status:
- done
- Garage is accepted as Kublai's maintained self-hosted validation and
  reference-deployment dependency.
- Managed S3-compatible storage remains preferred for `kublai.com` production.
- Boorchu remains deferred unless
  `docs/84-garage-operations-licensing-and-migration-decision.md` is
  superseded by a Garage rejection or exception.

### EGA-35T: Validate Garage compatibility evaluation lane

Scope:
- Add source-controlled checks that prove the Garage evaluation ticket has
  runnable validation hooks and documented acceptance criteria.
- Ensure the evaluation lane does not silently remove or replace the current
  MinIO fixture before Garage is certified.

Acceptance criteria:
- A unit-level artifact test asserts that the EGA board, Garage evaluation
  document, compose overlay, config, Make target, and validation script exist.
- Formatting validation covers the new Garage documentation and scripts.
- The validation lane names the exact Kublai object-storage integration test
  used for Garage compatibility.

Status:
- done in `tests/Kublai.Domain.Tests/EnterpriseGaTicketArtifactTests.fs`

### EGA-36: Expand Garage provider contract tests

Scope:
- Extend object-storage integration coverage beyond the happy-path multipart
  flow already proven against Garage.
- Add provider-neutral tests for delete semantics, missing-object mapping,
  invalid-range mapping, availability checks, metadata/ETag behavior, and
  aborting incomplete multipart uploads.
- Ensure the tests can run against MinIO, Garage, and managed S3-compatible
  providers through the existing `ObjectStorage__*` environment variables.

Acceptance criteria:
- Provider contract tests cover put/get/delete, multipart abort, missing
  object, invalid range, availability, metadata, presigned upload, and ranged
  read behavior.
- The Garage compatibility script runs the expanded provider contract suite,
  not only one happy-path test.
- Any Garage-specific behavioral difference is documented in
  `docs/83-garage-minio-replacement-evaluation.md` with severity and
  workaround.

Status:
- done in `tests/Kublai.Domain.Tests/ObjectStorageTests.fs`
- Garage compatibility report now covers provider availability, delete,
  missing-object, invalid-range, metadata/ETag, multipart abort, presigned
  upload, full download, and ranged download behavior.

### EGA-36T: Validate Garage provider contract tests in CI

Scope:
- Add validation coverage proving the expanded provider contract tests are
  source-controlled, runnable, and included in the Garage compatibility report.
- Ensure failures are easy to diagnose from test output and report evidence.

Acceptance criteria:
- Unit-level artifact tests assert that all required provider contract cases
  are present.
- `make test` covers the artifact assertions.
- `make garage-compatibility-validate` reports each contract category in
  `docs/reports/garage-compatibility-latest.md`.

Status:
- done in `tests/Kublai.Domain.Tests/EnterpriseGaTicketArtifactTests.fs`
- Artifact coverage asserts the provider contract test names and report
  categories that `make garage-compatibility-validate` must keep publishing.

### EGA-37: Add Garage-backed CI compatibility lane

Scope:
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow or CI job that runs the Garage compatibility
  target on Linux runners.
- Keep the lane separate from default MinIO integration until Garage is
  accepted as the replacement.
- Publish the Garage compatibility report as step summary or artifact.

Acceptance criteria:
- CI starts Garage, bootstraps layout/bucket/key, and runs the provider
  contract suite.
- The lane is triggered by changes to object-storage code, Garage compose/config,
  the Garage validator, and the EGA-35 documentation.
- A failed Garage compatibility run blocks object-storage changes once the lane
  is stable.

Status:
- done in `.github/workflows/garage-compatibility.yml`
- The workflow runs `make garage-compatibility-validate` on Linux runners,
  triggers on Garage/object-storage/EGA-35 evidence changes, and keeps Garage
  separate from the default MinIO integration lane.

### EGA-37T: Validate Garage CI evidence and report publication

Scope:
- Add checks that the Garage CI lane exists, invokes the correct Make target,
  and publishes the compatibility report.
- Prevent future edits from leaving EGA-35 with only local validation.

Acceptance criteria:
- Artifact tests assert the workflow references
  `make garage-compatibility-validate`.
- Workflow publishes `docs/reports/garage-compatibility-latest.md`.
- The EGA board links EGA-37 and EGA-37T as the CI evidence pair.

Status:
- done in `tests/Kublai.Domain.Tests/EnterpriseGaTicketArtifactTests.fs`
- Artifact coverage asserts the workflow invokes
  `make garage-compatibility-validate`, appends
  `docs/reports/garage-compatibility-latest.md` to the GitHub step summary,
  and uploads the same report as the `garage-compatibility-report` artifact.

### EGA-40: Resolve Garage compatibility Node 20 action warning

Scope:
- Upgrade `.github/workflows/garage-compatibility.yml` off any action versions
  that still execute on deprecated GitHub Actions Node 20 runtimes.
- Preserve the Garage compatibility report upload and job summary behavior.
- Re-run the Garage compatibility workflow after the action upgrade.

Acceptance criteria:
- The Garage compatibility workflow no longer emits a hosted-runner Node 20
  deprecation warning.
- `garage-compatibility` passes on `master` after the workflow action upgrade.
- The workflow still uploads `garage-compatibility-report` and publishes
  `docs/reports/garage-compatibility-latest.md` in the step summary.

Status:
- todo
- discovered during post-rc.3 evidence push on run `25978885047`
- warning source: `.github/workflows/garage-compatibility.yml` uses
  `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

### EGA-38: Add Garage option for kind and Helm validation dependencies

Scope:
- Add a selectable Garage dependency path for kind HA validation and Helm
  certification without removing the current MinIO fixture.
- Ensure chart values can point at Garage using the same S3-compatible
  `ObjectStorage__*` contract.
- Decide whether Garage should run as an in-cluster validation dependency or as
  an external endpoint for kind/Helm tests.

Acceptance criteria:
- `kind-ha-validate` can run with Garage as the object-storage dependency.
- `helm-certify` can run with Garage as the object-storage dependency.
- The default path remains unchanged until Garage CI and operations gates pass.
- Documentation explains how to choose MinIO, Garage, or managed S3-compatible
  storage for validation.

Status:
- done in `scripts/kind-ha-validate.sh`, `scripts/helm-certify.sh`,
  `deploy/kind/dependencies-garage.yaml`, and
  `deploy/helm/kublai/values-kind-garage.yaml`
- `KIND_OBJECT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=garage make kind-ha-validate` and
  `HELM_CERT_OBJECT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=garage make helm-certify` select Garage.
- `*_OBJECT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=external` keeps the same S3-compatible config
  surface for managed object storage.

### EGA-38T: Validate Garage kind and Helm dependency option

Scope:
- Add validation evidence for the Garage kind/Helm option.
- Ensure the dependency switch is covered by scripts or artifact tests so it
  cannot drift silently.

Acceptance criteria:
- Artifact tests assert the kind/Helm scripts expose a Garage dependency option.
- Helm/kind validation reports state which object-storage provider was used.
- Garage dependency validation is linked from the MinIO exit plan.

Status:
- done in `tests/Kublai.Domain.Tests/EnterpriseGaTicketArtifactTests.fs`
- Artifact coverage asserts the kind/Helm scripts expose `garage` and
  `external` provider modes, apply `deploy/kind/dependencies-garage.yaml`, use
  `deploy/helm/kublai/values-kind-garage.yaml`, and keep MinIO as the default.

### EGA-39: Document Garage operations, licensing, and migration decision

Scope:
- Document Garage backup/restore, disk layout, TLS/reverse-proxy assumptions,
  metrics, upgrades, key rotation, and failure recovery.

Status:
- done in `docs/84-garage-operations-licensing-and-migration-decision.md`
- The decision record covers day-0/day-1/day-2 operations, backup/restore,
  AGPLv3 release posture, MinIO-to-Garage migration, rollback, unsupported
  assumptions, and the go/no-go decision.

### EGA-39T: Validate Garage go/no-go decision artifacts

Scope:
- Add checks that the Garage operations/licensing/migration documentation and
  decision record exist before closing EGA-35.
- Ensure Boorchu cannot be started as a replacement project without an explicit
  Garage rejection or exception.

  files
- rebrand validation runs as part of `make test`

## Recommended Execution Order

1. Close P0 product envelope, release, install, support, SLO, HA, provenance,
   durable verification-evidence, launch infrastructure, storage-risk,
   branding, and CI runtime tickets: `EGA-01` through `EGA-14`, plus `EGA-31`
   through `EGA-34`, and `EGA-40`.
2. Close P1 procurement, compliance, security response, operator UX, tenant
   lifecycle, cloud examples, release-artifact drills, capacity certification,
   and package compatibility strategy: `EGA-15` through `EGA-25`.
3. Close P2 adoption accelerators after the first production candidate is
   stable: `EGA-26` through `EGA-29`.
4. Keep `EGA-30` deferred unless the enterprise support envelope expands to
   multi-region disaster recovery.

## Launch Gate

Do not call Kublai enterprise GA until all P0 tickets are closed and the
following evidence exists for a release candidate tag:

- passing CI and integration tests
- passing enterprise verification battery
- consolidated enterprise verification summary artifact
- signed release artifacts, signed images, signed chart, and SBOMs
- verified release provenance from downloaded artifacts
- Helm install and upgrade certification result
- production preflight result
- HA deployment validation report
- backup/restore, reliability, and upgrade drill reports
- security whitepaper and support envelope
- administrator handbook and cutover guide
- SLO/SLI and alert routing guide
- support bundle workflow evidence

P1 tickets should be closed before the first paid production customer unless a
specific exception is accepted in the GA sign-off board.
